# Technical test solution

I have to admit i've never used next js before, only React. And the same for Tailwind, i used vanilla css,Scss, bootstrap and tachyons.
So i take it as a challange and solved it !

- I did not use that much tailwind classes, in the ideea of practicing more my design skills
- I also could make the code more modular, to create components for select form, and for inputs but i decided to be more consitent leting it like that.
- My decision was to use a ref hook to track input and select form values
- The firebase integration is built in the firebase.js file




# As time, it took me around 2 hours, most of the time i read documentations, and the way of tailwind css. 

# My HOURLY FEE if i would be accepted for this project is 7 Euro / Hour --- 35 RON / ora netto/net

# In addition would be a pleasure to start my carrer with you !
